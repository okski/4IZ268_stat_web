                On December 19, 2013, JYP Entertainment announced that they would debut a new girl group in the first half of 2014 since 2010 under the name 6minx. On February 27, 2014, JYPE trainees Lena and Cecilia were confirmed as members of the group, while other rumored members included JYPE trainees Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Jisoo (later Jihyo) and Minyoung. After Cecilia's departure, JYP trainee Sana replaced her and 6mix was about to debut when Lena left the company, effectively canceling their debut.

            <p>
                On February 11, 2015, Park Jin-young announced that the lineup of JYP's upcoming seven member girl group would be decided through Sixteen, a competition survival show that would air on Mnet later that year. Park explained in a press conference that he want to upgrade this next group by adding elements like hip-hop and rap.
            </p>
            <p>
                The show began on May 5th and ended on July 7th with Nayeon, Sana, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Mina, Jihyo, and Jeongyeon as the seven Twice members. JYP then announced that he would be increasing the size of the group from 7 members to 9 by adding Tzuyu, who was the "audience's pick" since she was the most popular contestant by the show's end, and Momo, who was added by JYP himself since he felt the group needed someone with Momo's performance abilities. The decision was controversial at the time with many people complaining about eliminated contestants being able to join the group.

                Twice was to debut in late 2015. On July 10, 2015, Twice opened their official Instagram account with the first picture of the nine members posing together.

                Twice made their official debut on October 20, 2015, with the release of their debut EP The Story Begins, simultaneously with its lead single "Like Ooh-Ahh" alongside a live showcase to promote it. The group initially received a lukewarm reception; while their EP debuted at number 4 on the Gaon Album Chart for the week ending October 24 before peaking at number 3 two weeks later, its lead single "Like Ooh-Ahh" met moderate success debuting at number 22 on the Gaon Digital Chart.
            </p>
            <p>
                A week after its release, the single dropped to number 57 on South Korea's largest music site Melon, but through word of mouth from netizens regarding the group's subsequent promotions and performances, "Like Ooh-Ahh" reached within the top 10 of various Korean music charts including Melon, Genie, and Naver Music by November 15. Such a reverse run on music charts by a rookie girl group was deemed unusual by Korean media.

The music video for the group's single hit 50 million views on YouTube within five months of their debut and became one of the most-viewed debut music videos for any K-pop group.
